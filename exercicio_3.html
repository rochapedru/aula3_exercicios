    <p>You've been my muse for a long time<br>
        You get me through every dark night<br>
        I'm always gone, out on the go<br>
        I'm on the run and you're home alone<br>
        I'm too consumed with my own life<br>
<br>
        Are we too young for this?<br>
        Feels like I can't move<br>
<br>
        Sharing my heart<br>
        It's tearing me apart<br>
        But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now<br><br>
        Doing what I can, tryna be a man<br>
        And every time I kiss you, baby<br>
        I can hear the sound of breaking down<br>
<br>
        I've been confused as of late (yeah)<br>
        Watching my youth slip away (yeah)<br>
        You're like the Sun, you wake me up<br>
        But you drain me out if I get too much<br>
        I might need you or I'll break<br>
<br>
        Are we too young for this?<br>
        Feels like I can't move<br>
<br>
        Sharing my heart<br>
        It's tearing me apart<br>
        But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now<br>
        Doing what I can, tryna be a man<br>
        And every time I kiss you, baby<br>
        I can hear the sound of breaking down<br>
<br>
        (Breaking down, breaking down, breaking down)<br>
        (Breaking down, breaking down, breaking down)<br>
<br>
        I don't want to play this part<br>
        But I do, all for you<br>
        I don't want to make this hard<br>
        But I will 'cause I'm still<br>
<br>
        Sharing my heart<br>
        It's tearing me apart<br>
        But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now<br>
        (I know I would)<br>
        Doing what I can, tryna be a man (be your man)<br>
        And every time I kiss you, baby<br>
        I can hear the sound of breaking down<br>
<br>
        Sharing my bed, ooh<br>
        Sharing my bread, yeah<br>
        Sharing my bread<br>
        Sharing my head<br>
        (I'm breaking down)<br>
<br>
        Sharing my heart<br>
        Sharing my, suddenly I'm<br>
        (Breaking down)<br>
        Sharing, I'm done<br>
        Sharing my life<br>
